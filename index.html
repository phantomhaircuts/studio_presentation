          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          Hacking uses bugs or exploits to break into computer systems. The word “hacking” originally was coined to refer to fussing with machines back in the 60s at MIT.
          The term now has evolved to have many common meanings. <br>

          <h2>History of Hacking</h2>
          <p>

            <h3>1960s</h3>
            Hacking started at MIT <br>
            The term first meant people who alter technology to push it beyond its current capabilities<br>

            <h3>1970s</h3>
            Rise of Phreaking<br>
            Phone Hackers<br>

            John Draper AKA Captain Crunch<br>

            Packets of the Cap'n Crunch breakfast cereal included a free gift: a small whistle that, by coincidence, generated a 2600 Hz tone when one of the whistle's two holes was covered<br>

            Blue Box<br>
            A blue box is an electronic device that generates the in-band signaling tones formerly generated by telephone operator consoles to control telephone switches.<br>

            Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniack<br>

            <h3>1980s</h3>
            Rise of personal computers corresponding<br>
            with rise of black hat hacking<br>

            The 414s were a group of computer hackers who broke into dozens of high-profile computer systems, including ones at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and Security Pacific Bank, in 1982 and 1983.[1]<br>

            Robert Morris<br>
            The Morris worm or Internet worm of November 2, 1988, was one of the first computer worms distributed via the Internet, and the first to gain significant mainstream media attention. It also resulted in the first felony conviction in the US under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.[1] It was written by a graduate student at Cornell University, Robert Tappan Morris, and launched on November 2, 1988, from the computer systems of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<br>



            <h3>1990s</h3>
            1995 – Chris Lamprecht, aka ‘Minor Threat’, is the first person to be ever banned from the Internet.<br>
            1996 – Tim Lloyd plants a software time bomb at Omega Engineering, a company in New Jersey. The results of the attack are devastating: losses of USD $12 million and more than 80 employees lose their jobs. Lloyd is sentenced to 41 months in jail.<br>
            March 18, 1998 – Ehud Tenebaum, a prolific hacker aka ‘The Analyzer’, is arrested in Israel for hacking into many high profile computer networks in US.<br>
            <h3>2000s</h3>
            July 2001 – CodeRed worm released. It spreads quickly around the world, infecting a hundred thousand computers in a matter of hours<br>

          <h2>Types of Attacks</h2>
          <p>
            Q. What is SQL injection?<br>
            A. A SQL injection attack makes use of vulnerable user inputs in an application, and sends a malicious payload via SQL query.
            Attacks can potentially get user credentials, drop or delete a database, alter or add data etc.

            Q. What is a DDoS Attack?<br>
            A. A DoS or Denial of Service attack, is when an attacker renders a service unusuable and inaccessible by indefinitely disrupting services of a host.
            This attack is accomplished by flooding a target machine or resource with requests until it overloads the systems.
            A Distributed denial of service attack, distributes the incoming flood of traffice from multiple sources making it impossible to prevent the attack from simply blocking a single source.<br>
            Q. What is HTTP hacking?<br>
            A. Cross Site forgery attacks happen when a hacker sends a forged HTTP request to collect cookie information. Once the user’s session is compromised the hacker can generate requests to application identically to the user.<br>
            Q. What is a Phishing Attack<br>
            A. the fraudulent practice of sending emails purporting to be from reputable companies in order to induce individuals to reveal personal information, such as passwords and credit card numbers.<br>

          <br>
          <h2>Identifying Risks</h2>
          <p>
            <li># Don’t log in to unauthorized wifi</li>
            <li># Don’t give up emails in suspicious website</li>
            <li># Don’t fall for cheesy online game that give up your security question</li>
            <li># Make your password long and complex</li>
            <li># Don't plug a random USB into your machine</li>
            <br>
          </p>
          <h2>Roles:</h2>
          <h3># Black hat</h3>
          The goal of black hat is to hack user’s devices and gain access. During the night, black hats wake up and together decide which players they want to attack using gestures and hand movements. At this point, only the black hats know who they are, and must actively try and avoid suspicion during the day. Black hats must hack all the users before being discovered, in order to win.
          <h3>White hat</h3>
          The goal of the white hat is to help users identify the black hats and potential attacks. White hats are given the opportunity to investigate one player each night. The moderator reveals the player to be a black hat with a thumbs down and similarly, a thumbs up reveals the player to be a user. A sideways thumb means that the player is either a phisher or a grey hat.
          <h3>Grey hat</h3>
          Grey hat can choose to save or kill one player each night. They can not save and kill at the same time. He/She can only save once and kill once in one game setting. They have the freedom to decide whose side they want to play on.
          <h3>Phisher</h3>
          Phisher will be able to choose any player, blindly, to swap identities with. After the first round, the Phisher must open their eyes along with the group they swapped with. They must act against the group whose card they receive.
          User
          <h3>User</h3>
          Normal Internet user that should protect themselves from being hacked by black hats or potentially grey hats. During the day users, unaware of who is playing what roles, get to discuss and then vote on who they think is a black hat. This person, regardless of their role will be kicked out of the game. If Users discover all the black hats before the black hats hack the users, they win.
