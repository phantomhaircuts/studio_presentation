          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          Hacking uses bugs or exploits to break into computer systems. The word “hacking” originally was coined to refer to fussing with machines back in the 60s at MIT.
          The term now has evolved to have many common meanings. <br>
          <br>

          <h2>History of Hacking</h2>
          <p>
            The word “hacking” originally referred to fussing with machine back in the 60s at MIT. <br>
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>Types of Attacks</h2>
          <p>
            Q. What is SQL injection?<br>
            A. A SQL injection attack makes use of vulnerable user inputs in an application, and sends a malicious payload via SQL query.
            Attacks can potentially get user credentials, drop or delete a database, alter or add data etc.

            Q. What is a DDoS Attack?<br>
            A. A DoS or Denial of Service attack, is when an attacker renders a service unusuable and inaccessible by indefinitely disrupting services of a host.
            This attack is accomplished by flooding a target machine or resource with requests until it overloads the systems.
            A Distributed denial of service attack, distributes the incoming flood of traffice from multiple sources making it impossible to prevent the attack from simply blocking a single source.
            Q. What is HTTP hacking?<br>
            A. Cross Site forgery attacks happen when a hacker sends a forged HTTP request to collect cookie information. Once the user’s session is compromised the hacker can generate requests to application identically to the user.

          <h2>Identifying Risks</h2>
          <p>
            <li>Don’t log in to unauthorized wifi</li>
            <li>Don’t give up emails in suspicious website</li>
            <li>Don’t fall for cheesy online game that give up your security question</li>
            <li>Make your password long and complex.</li>
            <br>
          </p>

          <h2>Rules</h2>
